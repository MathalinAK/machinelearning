Al-->AI helps the machine to think without the human intervention(the machine will take its own decision)
ML-->it will focus on the algorithm which helps computer to learn the data(like predicting datas)
the inputs are called as feature vector.
it has two type:
    1.qualitative data(nominal data,ordinal data)--> categorical data
    2.quantitative data(discrete ,continuous)--->numerical data

qualitative:
    There will be a finite categories or groups.
    example: a boy ,a girl,we can say like two gender or categories,
    *Nominal data:(no inherent data)
        there is not any inherent order built into either of these categorical dataset.
        one hot encoding:its used to convert the categorical data into binary data(0,1)
