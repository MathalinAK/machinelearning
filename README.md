Al-->AI helps the machine to think without the human intervention(the machine will take its own decision)
ML-->it will focus on the algorithm which helps computer to learn the data(like predicting datas)
the inputs are called as feature vector.
it has two type:
    1.qualitative data(nominal data,ordinal data)--> categorical data.
    2.quantitative data(discrete ,continuous)--->numerical data.

qualitative:
There will be a finite categories or groups.
   	example: a boy ,a girl,we can say like two gender or categories,
    		*Nominal data:(no inherent data)
        	  there is not any inherent order built into either of these categorical dataset.
        	  one hot encoding:its used to convert the categorical data into binary data(0,1)
   		*ordinal data:(inherent order)
		  ex:education scale
		  The categorical data that has a clear order or ranking order among its categories,but the difference between those categories are measurable and consistent.
1.quantitative:
There will be numerical values data.
	*discrete:numerical value of data 
	  it only take specific values
	  the length of something (ex the temperature degree,the length(also count)
	*continuous:
	  it can take on an infinite number of values within a specific range (e.g., between 1.0 and 2.0, you can have 1.1, 1.11, 1.111, etc.).
	  it can be measured.we cant count them.
	  it can take any values(0.1,22.3)
Type of prediction:
classification--predict discrete classes.
1.binary classification:
  two prediction is or not (0,1).
2.multi class: 
  predict more than two or more categories.
1.k-nearest algorithm(model)
 plot data what is around you and take the label which has a majority to its nearest.
To find the our distance function we use Euclidean distance:
Precision and recall
Precision measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
Recall:
Recall measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all actual positive cases in the dataset.

F1-score is the combination of the recall and precision
